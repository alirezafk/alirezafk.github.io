            - Proposed a low-complexity method for jointly estimating the 3D-position and the clock offset of a user equipment (UE) in the downlink, using multiple RISs and a single base station (BS).
            - OFDM symbols are used for communication between UE and the BS.
            - The proposed method closely approaches the theoretical Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) values.
            - Extensive simulations and complexity analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones.

            - The challenging problem of three dimensional (3D) AOA localization is investigated with a moving receiver for locating multiple sources, which has not received much attention in recent studies.
            - Three novel low-complexity deep learning based networks are proposed to initially estimate the elevation and azimuth AOAs of sources.
            - An efficient 2D maximum likelihood (ML) based module is proposed to refine the obtained estimations using alternating projection technique and Nelder-Mead algorithm.
            - A novel multi-source localization approach is proposed for locating multiple sources using a moving array. An efficient gradient projection (GP) based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem.

            - A novel sparse recovery based 3D localization method is proposed for locating multiple sources using a moving array. The number of sources can be greater than the number of the sensors of the array.
            - An iterative energy detection approach to leverage the sparse characteristics of the received signal, effectively eliminating the presence of noisy samples within the signal.
            - To estimate the angles of arrival (AOAs), the 2D-MUSIC method is employed to obtain a preliminary estimation of the elevation and azimuth AOAs of the sources. Subsequently, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed that combines sparse recovery, phase smoothing, and the K-SVD algorithm techniques to achieve precise AOA estimation. These AOAs are then used to estimate the positions of sources.

        time: 
        company: 2022 - 2023
        details: |
            - Supervisor: Dr.~Saeed Akhavan
            - A novel framework consisting of two classification neural networks for multi-2D-DOA estimation is proposed for both coherent and non-coherent environments. 
            - Unlike previous convolutional neural network (CNN) based studies, a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is used to achieve improved detection and estimation of DOAs of incoming signals with respect to former studies.
            - The proposed framework not only estimates the pairing between elevation and azimuth DOAs, but also estimates the number of incoming signals, which is itself an important task study.
